# SDK is included as per-platform extraResources (below) to bypass node_modules auto-exclusion
# and to apply platform-specific ripgrep binary filtering.
# Since electron-builder v20.15.2, directories named "node_modules" are automatically excluded.
# Using extraResources with explicit from/to paths works around this limitation.
